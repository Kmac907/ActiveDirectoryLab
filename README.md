### [Project Walkthrough](https://kmac907.tech/)

<h2>Description</h2>
This Project goes through how to create an Active Directory Home Lab Environment. Simulating a small Enterprise using Oracle Virtual Box. This can be expanded on as more projects and VMs are made. A detailed walkthrough can be found on my portfolio(linked above). Where I document the projects that I do. The file for the PowerShell script is attached to this repository.
